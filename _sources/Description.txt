pyprojsetup provides a simple way to set up a python project. When you set up a project using this package, you get:

* A new directory structure within a virtual environment
* A new github repo
* A few python files to get you started
* The reStructuredText skeleton of the project's documentation
* A Makefile to facilitate development work
* Projects made with pyprojsetup will include a command-line executable and a man page on the client's system when installed via :code:`pip` or :code:`python setup.py install`.
